# What is TaskCore?

It is a simple **cross-platform ToDo management application** for those who live inside a terminal where you don't have a fancy GUI. 

This application works almost on any platform which includes Linux Distros, MacOS, and Windows. It does not require any runtime to be installed on the target machine, and it is only one single executable that can be copied anywhere.

## Why did you name it TaskCore?

"Task" simply represents what this application is helping people with. "Core" represents its simplicity and how it works on a terminal environment.

# Why?

Why not? Not everyone likes fancy GUIs or works in X Window environments or prefer leaving their simple looking terminal environment. This application is not for everyone. You should have a special taste for the command line environments. 

# Demo

## How to contribute? 

I am adding the new features I am planning to add here: https://github.com/tarikguney/taskcore/projects/1. You can grab one of the not active one, and let me know if you are working on them. You can also be a beta tester and create issues here if you see any problem: https://github.com/tarikguney/taskcore/issues. Thanks for considering to contribute to the project.

# How it works?

## Managing Tasks

Add a new task item with priority 1 (highest) and due date:
```bash
taskcore add -n "Finish up Task Core" -d 10/11/2020 -p 1
```

Complete a task item - Passing multiple Ids is allowed:
```bash
taskcore c -i 3 2 4
```

List all active task items:
```bash
taskcore ls
```

List all task items including completed ones:

```bash
taskcore ls -c
```

List tasks under a given category:
```
taskcore ls -ca Project
```

Remove a task item - Passing multiple Ids is allowed:
```bash
taskcore rm -i 3 2 3
```

## Managing Categories

Add a new category:

```bash
taskcore addc -n "Work"
```
Add a task item to a category:

```c#
taskcore add -t "Check if the command works" -d 01/01/2010 -c Work
```
Remove a category:

```bash
taskcore rmc -n "Work"
```

## Clear Database

Delete the database folder, `--force` is required:

```bash
taskcore clear --force
```

## Configuration

TaskCore supports the following environment variables:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Variable</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TASKCORE_DB_PATH</td>
    <td>Set the DB path</td>
  </tr>
</table>

# CommandCore Framework

This application is using another project I developed named "CommandCore" as its underlying framework for command parsing and project layout management. CommandCore is an opinionated MVC-based framework for command line application development. You can find more information at [CommandCore Github Page](https://www.github.com/tarikguney/command-core).

# Installation

You can download an executable for your system: [here](https://github.com/tarikguney/taskcore/releases)

Alternatively, taskcore is available in the following package managers:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Arch Linux AUR<br>
        (<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/taskcore">build from source</a>)</td>
    <td><code>yay -S taskcore</code>
        <br>or<br>
        <code>git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/taskcore.git</code><br>
        <code>cd taskcore</code><br>
        <code>makepkg -si</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

# Want to build locally?

Run the folowing command for the desired operating system. The final executable will be self-contained and single executable file. You don't need to have .NET Core runtime in the target computer where you are planning to run the published binary.

## Linux
```
dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained true --runtime linux-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishTrimmed=true ./TaskCore.App/TaskCore.App.csproj
```

## Windows 10
```
dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained true --runtime win10-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishTrimmed=true  .\TaskCore.App\TaskCore.App.csproj
```

## MacOS
```
dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained true --runtime osx-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishTrimmed=true ./TaskCore.App/TaskCore.App.csproj
```

Then, go to `in/Release/netcoreapp3.1/osx-x64/publish` to locate outputted executable named `taskcore` and run the `taskcore` using the subcommands above.
